          <h3>Sailmoren</h3>
          <p>Sailmoren was made by Kaise (Deity of Magic), May (Goddess of War and Binding), Vale (God of Water), and Valley (Goddess of Animals). The deities visit often and interact with the people. Kasie is considered the main deity, since they come here most often. More than these deities visit, but they don't stay too long.</p>
          <p>Sailmoren is ruled by two main kingdoms, Zanya and Skyward. They have been at war for ages, taking land from one another constantly. They both almost wiped out each other, till Vale and Valley lifted the mountains from the water. The mountains keep people from invading easily. The waters on the outside of the kingdoms are surrounded by dangerous sea monsters and death. Those who try to cross never return.</p>
          <p>The Kingdom of Skyward is ruled by the King, Halm, and his husband Sal. They have a team of advisors and representatives who help them decide on actions. During winter there are many festivals and activities. Skyward is an industrial and innovative kingdom, every year they hold a fair to show off new inventions. Each island holds a purpose, producing an essential resource for people's way of life.</p>

          <h3>Youb</h3>
          <img src="images/Map of Youb.jpg" alt="Map of Youb" title="Map of Youb"/>
          <p>Youb is known as the island people go to for starting a family and retirement. Most of Youb's residents are farmers, because of the rich nutrients in the soil. The island is also known for its Spring Equinox festival, more known as the Releasing Ceremony. People from all over the island come to the festival. During the festival, people make wooden boats and write their wrongdoings, what they regret, what they're sorry for, and what they want to want to manifest in them. Then they put the boat in the water, and light it on fire. The people believe this sends their messages into the universe and frees them.</p>
          <p>The characters either live in this town or came for the festival. Everyone got a Flyer either from bumping into someone, feeling it in their pockets or in finding it in their mailbox. The flyer is addressed to them and tells them to come to a meeting. They all arrive at the meeting for their own reasons. But everyone shows up and that's where the campaign begins.</p>
