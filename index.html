          <h3>Jaun</h3>
          <p>Jaun was a peaceful planet, it consisted of three continents Main, Zaydia, and Central. Main was in the modern day era with its citizens not knowing of magic's existence. While the people of Zaydia's lives were filled with it, magic was used everywhere you walked. Not much was known of Central, they usually keep to themselves. Zaydia didn't know other continents were being so primitive. However Main had satellites, so they had very accurate maps of each but didn't feel it was necessary to leave Main.</p>
          <p>This all changed when a group of adventures came from all three continents to stop a Primordial Being named The Beast. This group of adventures brought tech and magic from their homelands to each continent, leading each continent to prosper. While a couple of other world-ending events happened, nothing compares to the calamity (see calamity in the world info tab). The calamity changed the world and universe as everyone knew it.</p>
          <p>In the present day (100 years after the calamity), the people of Jaun live in a magic-starved world. All living things need magic to survive, with the limited amount in the atmosphere, food struggles to grow like it used to. Few people are born with the ability to wield the magic inside them. If the world continues like this, no creature will be able to survive. This lack of magic has created tension among people. An us against them is the common outlook of many of the people. Which leads to high crime rates, and more job opportunities for adventures like you guys.</p>
