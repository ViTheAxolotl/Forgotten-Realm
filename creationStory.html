          <h3><b>The Originals</b></h3>
            <p>The universe started as a blank void or a canvas. Then a glow is shown and 7 beings came from it. These beings are called the originals. All with their special abilities, they all shine in their ways. After coming into existence, they realized they needed to make it livable. So Blink (Deity of Space) and their lover Timey (God of Time) created time and space. This brought ease to the deities, however, this wasn’t enough for them. So Salidor (Goddess of Earth) created the first planet for the deities to live in, Exanina. Though on Exanina a major problem was realized, time wasn’t linear. Everywhere they went, the future and past would spill in. This birthed a being, Zane, the Agent of chaos. Zane would spread his chaos and endanger the deities every time they tried to do anything. So Timey worked to find out how to make time linear, to avoid the outbreaks. The only solution he could find was to put himself in a coma-like state. This fixed the problem, and Zane vanished. </p>
            <p>While Exanina was a great place, some of the deities got lonely and hated being stuck in the same place. So four of the deities came together, Salidor, The Enchantress (The Immortal Entity), Hunmie (Deity of Nature), and Zanthith (God of War and Binding). Salidor created the map of the universe, and with help from Blink, created the Neither Realms. The Neither Realms is a place in between the worlds. It has a fountain with a statue and a pool of water for each world. The map of the universe was used to plot out planet locations. The 4 creators went to the first location, named First World. Salidor used her powers to create a globe of earth. Then Hunmie placed the first root of a tree into the earth. This tree is called “The Mana Tree”. Then The Enchantress went to the tree, she cast her magic into the tree. And Zanthith bound her magic to be a part of the tree for its entire life. This tree was made to give magic to the world. The Creators knew that life can’t exist without magic, so this was their first creation. The tree took anti-magic and converted it to magic. Every planet needed a Mana Tree for life to be able to live.</p> 
            <p>The next thing to be created was plants and humans. Together Hunmie and Zanthith created the life of plants. Though Hunmie can create plants on her own, once she stopped feeding her magic into them they would decay. So Zanthith infused the earth with the magic from the Mana Tree so that the earth could give nutrients to the plants. While they were doing this, Salidor created water from the Mana Tree. This water formed a river, an ocean, and ponds. Then Hunmie, The Enchantress, and Zanthith created the first animal, a cow. Hunmie created the cow from her plants since the cow wasn’t connected to the earth, it needed to be connected to magic. The Enchantress infused her magic into the cow so it wouldn’t decay. Then Zanthith bound her spell to the DNA of the cow, so its descendants would retain the spell. He also infused the magic given off by the Mana Tree into the cow so it can have fuel for the spell. Using this idea, they created all of the animals and humans. </p>
            <p>Over time, humans started interacting with things connected to the mana tree, including rivers and plants. This led to them having different levels of magic, and different variations. Creating different races. After races started forming, The Enchantress appeared before the people. She showed them how to cast the magic, from the spell she used to keep them alive. Since people started discriminating against and killing non-humans, she spend more time with the non-humans. Showing them powerful spells and how to use their differences to help them survive. She started seeing that with the magic they have, the more they practiced and used it, the stronger they got. But after a while, the humans got spells and stuff from the other races and used them against them. This made The Enchantress mad, she went to her lover Humnie to ask for guidance. Hunmie got Salidor and together they created natural barriers to separate humans from the other races. Creating mountains, valleys, and forests. They all took everything they learned from this and used it to create more worlds. Till we arrive at our universe as we know it.</p>
          
          <h3><b>Children Of The Gods</b></h3>
            <p>Over time the deities decided to have children. The first child was Gaymon (God of Love), the child of Hunmie and The Enchantress. The child was granted divinity, to Hunmie’s delight. However, their next child Zanxa was born. Just like her mother, she wasn’t granted powers. This lets the deities find out that not all their children would be deities. As more and more children are born, those who were granted divinity were the ones who got attention. While the other children were treated as if they didn’t matter. This led to a group of “The Fallen Gods of Zanxa” being born.</p>
            <p>Zanxa noticed how some of the kids were being treated, some of them being killed just because they weren’t divine. Zanxa decided to do something about it. Zanxa, while not divine, still had magic from her mom. She decided to adopt and save the kids from the mistreatment. She retreated from Exanina to go to First World. Once there she showed her powers to the locals. They saw her magic and thought she was The Enchantress, so they started worshiping her. Zanxa fell for Slicer’s daughter Candie, Candie helped save her siblings from Slicer's wrath. Zanxa and Candie spent 2 years among the First Worldians and the non-divine. Till Slicer found Candie, he was angry that she saved his children from him. He saw The Fallen Gods of Zanxa as a threat. So he burned down their encampment. Candie, seeing her siblings and the other non-divine endanger, used her fire powers to keep the flames towards her so they could escape. The fires, being divine, were too strong for her fire-immune skin. She was engulfed by the flames, while Zanxa watched trying to get rid of the flames. The last words Candie said were, “Don’t stay Zanxa, let my sacrifice keep you and all of our children safe. GO, I CAN’T KEEP THE FLAMES MUCH LONGER. I LOVE Y-” with a tear falling down her face.</p>
            <p>Zanxa is filled with rage from Slicer killing her wife, went to her worshipers. Her worshipers took her to the Mana Tree. She decided the only way to kill a god is to connect directly to the tree. She did a ritual for 30 days with the locals, which numbers equaled 451. She was able to have enough magic together to bind herself to the Mana Tree. Using this power, she crafted an arrow, she hoped that it would be able to kill the gods.</p>
            <p>Zanxa and some of the other kids marched up to Exanina. They went to the Flame Kingdom and broke the doors down. People on both sides died during the siege. Till Zanxa reached Slicer’s throne. She said to Slicer, “You have killed the love of my life Candie. Why?” Slicer responded, “Who is Candie again?” As he finished his sentence, a tear rolled down Zanxa’s face. She spoke the wake word into the arrow and shot. The arrow pierced Slicer’s heart. He laughed, “Foolish waste of oxygen, you can’t kill a god.” He pulled the arrow out and filled it with fire. Since Zanxa was connected to the arrow, she and the Mana Tree were burnt alive. Thus ended First World.</p>
            <p>After First World burned and decayed, from its ashes came Zane (Agent of Chaos) once more. He appeared on an empty planet, thousands of years in the future. Zane spent a year trying to get back to Exanina. Blink (Deity of Space) was the first to feel his presence. They went straight to Saildor with the information. Saildor decided that just fixing the problem wasn’t enough. Zane will always come back when chaos breaks out. Saildor, with the help of The Enchantress, crafted a spell to be a perfect prison for Zane. Saildor called it Majora’s Mask, it would capture Zane in it and could only be broken by a sigil, only known by The Enchantress. So the deities got to work to make the mask, each deity had a part of the plan. Then when Zane reached the Exanina, he was in for a surprise. He was hit by a ray of powers, one after another. Then when he was in his weakened state, Zanthith (God of War and Binding) bound him to the mask. And kept him in a heavily enchanted case.</p>
