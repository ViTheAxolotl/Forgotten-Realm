The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away. \n{@Choice} A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like. \nThe chosen property lasts indefinitely.

If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement. \nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.\nYou can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table.
