            <h3>Map of Zaydia</h3>
            <p>Zaydia was the more Midevil side of the world. Zaydia was united under the rule of half-demon King Alm, his uniting of demon and humanoid kind is what led him to spread his influence around Zaydia. During The Calamity, however, he abandoned the other nations in favor of keeping his own kingdom safe. This led to tons of power struggles in each nation as they split and created new lines of division. This was further escalated when tons of strangers were placed around the world creating confusion and chaos.</p>

            <h5>Havenport</h5>
              <p>The Kingdom of Havenport is the 2nd biggest kingdom in Zaydia. With its size more and more people come here looking for good soil and better opportunities. King Salve has ruled Havenport for 120 years, his late wife was his motivation. After her passing 4 years ago he has taken a step back in ruling Havenport. Now his son Grado is the head of the kingdom, his mission is to provide clean water and food to each town. Since he has taken charge, he instated the Clean Water and Food Act. This requires each town to provide a free meal each week to whoever can't afford one. Of course, the food isn't the best, but it keeps everyone alive.</p>
            <h5>Salatude</h5>
              <p>The Kingdom of Salatude is the Kingdom that united all of the nations under King Alm. This Kingdom is the biggest and richest of them all, with trade routes established to almost every kingdom. A few years after The Calamity, King Alm went missing, some believe he went mad looking for his missing daughter and husband. His Succubus son, Thallos, has taken over the kingdom and created peace between its towns. Could it be that all the town rulers are in love with Thallos or that he is just a good diplomat? The world may never know.</p>
            <h5>Slarus' Coast</h5>
              <p>Slarus' Coast, or Slarus for short, is the main docking Kingdom in Zaydia. Shipments from Main and Lainen keep Slarus busy, being the second richest kingdom in Zaydia, it has trade deals with most other locations on the map. With so much trading and shipping, it requires the population to back it up. People from nearby towns, even from other kingdoms, come looking for work. Being a big port also adds tons of piracy and bandits looking to make some coin. You would think that the people would be making good coin, but most of the money goes to the royal family. The people believed that the royals couldn't care less about the wellbeing of their citizens.</p>
            <h5>Wastelands</h5>
              <p>The Wastelands is a desert going on for miles with no end. The majority of adventures avoid the Wastelands because of the sand storms, these are not ordinary sand storms, however. The sand radiates the skin off of anything it touches, in a matter of minutes the person will be dead. However, some idiots try to make it to the Promised Land, which is rumored to lie in the Wastelands. This Promised Land is said to cure people of their diseases and stop their aging. But these are just childhood stories passed from generation to generation. There are some small sanctuaries place in the Wastelands however, mainly because the people that were spawned there can't leave without fear of dying.</p>
