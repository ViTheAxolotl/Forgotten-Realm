          <p>The Calamity all started with May (Goddess of Binding). One day she just snapped, she grabbed the Yoto (God Slayer) and started hunting each demi-god. No one saw it coming, the demi-gods just vanished. At first, no one thought anything about it. Till more than half were dead, the gods then went into high alert. May was told about the demi-gods being killed and to be on the lookout. May realized that she needed to be careful from now on, so she summoned her demon friends from beyond the grave and fused their souls to the dead demigods. This was an effort to stay incognito for longer. These demons were sent out by the hundreds to hunt all demigods. While that was going on, May would get all buddy-buddy with her siblings and kill them one by one. She would absorb their marbles and use them to help her.</p>
          <p>As it turns out May, wasn't a nobody before her ascension. She was the demon who powered the binding marble. When the Yoto was being designed, they knew it would kill him. So they needed a new deity who wouldn't destroy the safeguard, the yoto. They both thought that May would be the best person to ascend. So Zanthith unbound May to the marble and sent her free to wait for the time the yoto is made.</p>
          <p>May's plan was revealed, she wanted to use all of the marbles to reset the timeline. Create a world where her siblings could be at rest and be free. May almost got away with it if it wasn't for a group of adventures. The adventures with help from the remaining gods, unbounded the marbles, as each got unbound they got rebound to the adventures. They realized they couldn't kill May, she was holding everything together with her marble. Hope's only option was to reset the timeline after destroying the binding marble. Hope with the help of Falion chose a planet and people around the galaxy to travel back in time. This leads us to now, where there is not a deity in sight, and diseases and famon are everywhere.</p>
