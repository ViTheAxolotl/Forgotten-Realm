          <p>The Calamity all started with May (Goddess of Binding). One day she just snapped, she grabbed the Yoto (God Slayer) and started hunting each demi-god. No one seen it coming, the demi-gods just vanised. At first, no one thought anything about it. Till more than half were dead, the gods then went into high alert. May was told about the demi-gods being killed and to be on the look out.</p>
          <p>May relized that she needed to be careful now on, so she summoned her demon friends from behond the grave and fused their souls to the dead demi-gods. This was an effort to stay incogneto for longer. These demons weresent out by the hundreds to hunt all demi-gods. While that was going on, May would get all buddy-buddy with her siblings and kill them one by one. She wold obsorb their marbles and use them to help her.</p>
          <p>As it turns out May, wasn't a nobody before her ascention. She was the demon who powered the binding marble. When the Yoto was being designed, they knew it would kill him. So they needed a new deity who wouldn't destroy the safeguard, the yoto. The both thought that May would be the best person to ascend. So Zanthith unbound May to the marble and sent her free to wait for the time the yoto is made.</p>
          <p>May's plan reveild was that she wanted to use all of the marbles to reset the timeline. Create a world where her siblings could be at rest and be free. May almost got a way with it if it wasn't for a group of adventures. The adventures with help from the remaining gods, unbounded the marbles, as each got unbound they got rebound to the adventures. They relized they couldn't kill May, she was holding everything together with her marble. Hope's only option was to reset the timeline after destroying the binding marble. Hope with the help of Falion chose a planet and people around the galaxy to travel back in time. Leading us to now, where there is not a deity in sight, and diese and famon are everywhere.</p>
